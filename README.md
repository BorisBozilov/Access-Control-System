# Access Control System

The access control and time attendance system described in this development is based on the use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. RFID cards are passive and receive energy to work from the reader's electromagnetic field. RFID readers are devices that are used to transmit electromagnetic fields to the card, communicate with the card, and provide an audio-visual indication that the card has been read correctly.

The system, being developed primarily for educational purposes, is built from general purpose PC hardware, widely available on the market at relatively low prices, based on the MS Windows operating system.

For the development needs of the control module, an Intel mini PC computer with a WiFi module, eight USB ports, which are sufficient for the input and output devices, was purchased. The device runs software that implements the access control function and the user registration function.

The mini computer is equipped with two USB RFID card readers (125kHz), two USB webcams, standard HID keyboards with one programmable button (as input devices) and a two-channel USB programmable relay and 12V electromagnetic lock (as output and executive devices ).
