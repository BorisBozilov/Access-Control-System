# Access Control System

The access control and time attendance system described in this development is based on the use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. RFID cards are passive and receive energy to work from the reader's electromagnetic field. RFID readers are devices that are used to transmit electromagnetic fields to the card, communicate with the card, and provide an audio-visual indication that the card has been read correctly.

The system, being developed primarily for educational purposes, is built from general purpose PC hardware, widely available on the market at relatively low prices, based on the MS Windows operating system.
